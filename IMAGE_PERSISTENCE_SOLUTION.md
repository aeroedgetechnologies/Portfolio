# Image Persistence Solution

## Problem
The chat application was experiencing image loss after server restarts on Render (and other cloud platforms) due to ephemeral file systems. When the server restarted, all files in the `uploads` folder were permanently deleted, even though the database still contained file metadata.

## Solution: Base64 Encoding
We've implemented a base64 encoding solution that stores images directly in the database as base64 strings, making them persistent across server restarts.

### How It Works

1. **File Upload**: When a file is uploaded, it's converted to base64 and stored in the database
2. **Data URLs**: Images are served as data URLs (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`) instead of file URLs
3. **Persistence**: Since the base64 data is stored in MongoDB, images survive server restarts
4. **Frontend**: The frontend automatically handles data URLs and displays images correctly

### Changes Made

#### Backend Changes (`server/index.js`)
- Changed from `multer.diskStorage` to `multer.memoryStorage`
- Updated file schema to include `base64Data` and `isImage` fields
- Modified upload endpoints to convert files to base64
- Added data URL generation for images
- Added migration endpoint for existing files

#### Frontend Changes (`src/components/ChatRoom.tsx`)
- Updated `getFullUrl()` function to handle data URLs
- Modified file upload handlers to work with data URLs
- Updated profile picture upload to use data URLs

### Benefits
- ✅ Images persist across server restarts
- ✅ No external file storage dependencies
- ✅ Works with any cloud platform
- ✅ Automatic fallback for missing files
- ✅ No configuration changes needed

### Limitations
- ⚠️ Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33%
- ⚠️ Database size will grow with image uploads
- ⚠️ 5MB file size limit (configurable)

### Migration
If you have existing images that were lost after a server restart, you can run the migration endpoint once to convert any remaining files to base64:

```bash
POST /api/migrate-files-to-base64
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

### Usage
The solution is transparent to users - they can upload images normally, and the system automatically handles the base64 conversion and persistence.

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing image compression to reduce database size
- Add support for cloud storage services (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for larger files
- Implement file cleanup for old/unused images
